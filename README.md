#  Daily Report Tracker

## Introduction
Project Description
The Daily Report Tracker is a Command-Line Interface (CLI) application designed to help
users efficiently record and manage their daily activities. The application provides a simple way to
log daily tasks, track challenges, and document personal reflections, making it useful for
students, professionals, and individuals who want to maintain a structured record of their daily
progress.
Each report entry consists of:
• Date: The specific day the entry was recorded.
• What I did today: A summary of completed tasks and activities.
• Challenges faced: Any obstacles or difficulties encountered.
• Today’s Remark: A general reflection on the day's productivity.
